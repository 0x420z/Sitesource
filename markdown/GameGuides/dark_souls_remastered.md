## Tips and Tricks

* It is extremely recommended set the game as Offline while using CE, otherwise you can risk a softban.

* For the camera script work you need to install the Stealth Edit 2.4, It can be found for download at the same link as the CT. It is required for the full functioning of the CT, the camera script will not work without it. Check the README inside the stealthedit2.4 folder for the setup of this plugin.
