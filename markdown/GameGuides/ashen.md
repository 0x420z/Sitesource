##Tips and Tricks

### Quickly enter console commands
There is seemingly no way to bind commands to keys using the console. If you want to freeze the game, you need to open the console and type out "FreezeFrame" or scroll up to a previously entered command and press enter.

You can use any macro software in order to create macros to open the console, type the commands, and close the console all in a split second. You can chain several commands in a single macro if you're constantly entering the same commands every time you launch the game.

Example macros using Corsair Utiliy Engine (for Corsair keyboards):
