## Tips

@alert tip
**Using DSR**  
The game is quite picky whether it will detect DSR resolutions. If you have a 2560x1440 monitor, for example, and have a DSR resolution of 3840x2160 most games will detect this and allow you to select it in their options. As of the current patch AC7 won't detect this. Set your desktop resolution to the DSR resolution before starting the game and make sure you select full screen as the display type. DSR resolutions should display now.

@alert tip
**Using DSR with borderless window**  
Follow the above instructions to get the game to recognise DSR resolutions. Set the resolution in full screen mode and then change to borderless. The selected resolution should remain as long as it is the same as the desktop DSR resolution.
