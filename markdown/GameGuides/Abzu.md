## Hotsampling
Hotsampling works with the game, the only problem comes after rezising the window altabing to the game which it rezise again to the previous resolution. For taking shoots i suggest using MSI Afterburner (and install RivaTurner that comes with the installation) wich will allow you to take photos without 
being in the window of the game (be sure to config the desire hotkey in the configs of MSI Afterburner).
