The console has a history. Simply press arrow-up to get the list of last entered commands. This allows you to quickly switch between previously entered commands like `ToggleDebugCamera`, `r.PostProcessAAQuality 2` etc. It's advisable to switch off the HUD before enabling the debug camera, as sometimes some HUD elements aren't hidden when the debug camera is enabled.

There's no tilt in the Debug camera in Unreal Engine. Best way to control it is via the keyboard + mouse. Use mouse wheel to control the movement speed, WASD for movement and Q + E to move up/down.
