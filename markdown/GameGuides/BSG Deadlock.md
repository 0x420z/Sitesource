## Tips

@alert tip
**Main Script**  
The main script can take a while to activate as there are a number of AOB scans. Give it time to run.
@end

@alert tip
**Replay Mode**  
The game's replay mode provides a time stop and HUD toggle. It's probably best to use the camera features in this CT in that mode.

**Features**: Camera control, FOV Control, Remove Replay Borders, No Clip, Post Processing (AA, AO and Bloom). I've named the post process settings as best as I could figure them out - that said, they may not be what they say they are so use with caution.
