## Tips and Tricks

Useful console commands: 

TogglePhotoMode
:	Enables the official photo mode for Fallen Order by Respawn.

`r.DepthOfQuality 0` 
:	Disables the vanilla DOF

`r.motionblurquality 0`
:	Disables the motion blur


The console has a history. Simply press arrow-up to get the list of last entered commands. This allows you to quickly switch between 
previously entered commands like ToggleDebugCamera, r.PostProcessAAQuality 2 etc. It's advisable to switch off the HUD before enabling the 
debug camera, as sometimes some HUD elements aren't hidden when the debug camera is enabled.
